Returns the previous value for\n    *pause*.\n-   **\"`setstepmul`\":** sets `arg` as the new value for the *step\n    multiplier* of the collector (see [§2.5](#2.5)). Returns the\n    previous value for *step*.\n-   **\"`isrunning`\":** returns a boolean that tells whether the\n    collector is running (i.e., not stopped).\n-   **\"`generational`\":** changes the collector to generational mode.\n    This is an experimental feature (see [§2.5](#2.5)).\n-   **\"`incremental`\":** changes the collector to incremental mode.

For instance, if the\nC path is the string\n\n         \"./?.so;./?.dll;/usr/local/?/init.so\"\n\nthe searcher for module `foo` will try to open the files `./foo.so`,\n`./foo.dll`, and `/usr/local/foo/init.so`, in that order. Once it finds\na C library, this searcher first uses a dynamic link facility to link\nthe application with the library. Then it tries to find a C function\ninside the library to be used as the loader. The name of this C function\nis the string \"`luaopen_`\" concatenated with a copy of the module name\nwhere each dot is replaced by an underscore. Moreover, if the module\nname has a hyphen, its prefix up to (and including) the first hyphen is\nremoved. For instance, if the module name is `a.v1-b.c`, the function\nname will be `luaopen_b_c`.\n\nThe fourth searcher tries an *all-in-one loader*. It searches the C path\nfor a library for the root name of the given module. For instance, when\nrequiring `a.b.c`, it will search for a C library for `a`. If found, it\nlooks into it for an open function for the submodule; in our example,\nthat would be `luaopen_a_b_c`. With this facility, a package can pack\nseveral C submodules into one single library, with each submodule\nkeeping its original open function.\n\nAll searchers except the first one (preload) return as the extra value\nthe file name where the module was found, as returned by\n[`package.searchpath`](#pdf-package.searchpath). The first searcher\nreturns no extra value.",

For each template, the function replaces each interrogation\nmark (if any) in the template with a copy of `name` wherein all\noccurrences of `sep` (a dot, by default) were replaced by `rep` (the\nsystem's directory separator, by default), and then tries to open the\nresulting file name.\n\nFor instance, if the path is the string\n\n         \"./?.lua;./?.lc;/usr/local/?/init.lua\"\n\nthe search for the name `foo.a` will try to open the files\n`./foo/a.lua`, `./foo/a.lc`, and `/usr/local/foo/a/init.lua`, in that\norder.\n\nReturns the resulting name of the first file that it can open in read\nmode (after closing the file), or **nil** plus an error message if none\nsucceeds.

When indexing a\nstring in Lua, the first character is at position 1 (not at 0, as in C).\nIndices are allowed to be negative and are interpreted as indexing\nbackwards, from the end of the string. Thus, the last character is at\nposition -1, and so on.\n\nThe string library provides all its functions inside the table `string`.\nIt also sets a metatable for strings where the `__index` field points to\nthe `string` table. Therefore, you can use the string functions in\nobject-oriented style. For instance, `string.byte(s,i)` can be written\nas `s:byte(i)`.\n\nThe string library assumes one-byte character encodings.",

The\nfollowing combinations are allowed in describing a character class:\n\n-   ***x*:** (where *x* is not one of the *magic characters*\n    `^$()%.[]*+-?`) represents the character *x* itself.\n-   **`.`:** (a dot) represents all characters.\n-   **`%a`:** represents all letters.\n-   **`%c`:** represents all control characters.\n-   **`%d`:** represents all digits.\n-   **`%g`:** represents all printable characters except space.\n-   **`%l`:** represents all lowercase letters.\n-   **`%p`:** represents all punctuation characters.\n-   **`%s`:** represents all space characters.\n-   **`%u`:** represents all uppercase letters.\n-   **`%w`:** represents all alphanumeric characters.\n-   **`%x`:** represents all hexadecimal digits.\n-   **`%x`:** (where *x* is any non-alphanumeric character) represents\n    the character *x*. This is the standard way to escape the magic\n    characters. Any punctuation character (even the non magic) can be\n    preceded by a '`%`' when used to represent itself in a pattern.\n-   **`[set]`:** represents the class which is the union of all\n    characters in *set*. A range of characters can be specified by\n    separating the end characters of the range, in ascending order, with\n    a '`-`', All classes `%`*x* described above can also be used as\n    components in *set*. All other characters in *set* represent\n    themselves. For example, `[%w_]` (or `[_%w]`) represents all\n    alphanumeric characters plus the underscore, `[0-7]` represents the\n    octal digits, and `[0-7%l%-]` represents the octal digits plus the\n    lowercase letters plus the '`-`' character.\n    The interaction between ranges and classes is not defined.\n    Therefore, patterns like `[%a-z]` or `[a-%%]` have no meaning.\n-   **`[^set]`:** represents the complement of *set*, where *set* is\n    interpreted as above.\n\nFor all classes represented by single letters (`%a`, `%c`, etc.), the\ncorresponding uppercase letter represents the complement of the class.\nFor instance, `%S` represents all non-space characters.\n\nThe definitions of letter, space, and other character groups depend on\nthe current locale. In particular, the class `[a-z]` may not be\nequivalent to `%l`.\n\n#### Pattern Item:\n\nA *pattern item* can be\n\n-   a single character class, which matches any single character in the\n    class;\n-   a single character class followed by '`*`', which matches 0 or more\n    repetitions of characters in the class. These repetition items will\n    always match the longest possible sequence;\n-   a single character class followed by '`+`', which matches 1 or more\n    repetitions of characters in the class. These repetition items will\n    always match the longest possible sequence;\n-   a single character class followed by '`-`', which also matches 0 or\n    more repetitions of characters in the class. Unlike '`*`', these\n    repetition items will always match the shortest possible sequence;\n-   a single character class followed by '`?`', which matches 0 or 1\n    occurrence of a character in the class;\n-   `%n`, for *n* between 1 and 9; such item matches a substring equal\n    to the *n*-th captured string (see below);\n-   `%bxy`, where *x* and *y* are two distinct characters; such item\n    matches strings that start with *x*, end with *y*, and where the *x*\n    and *y* are *balanced*. This means that, if one reads the string\n    from left to right, counting *+1* for an *x* and *-1* for a *y*, the\n    ending *y* is the first *y* where the count reaches 0. For instance,\n    the item `%b()` matches expressions with balanced parentheses.\n-   `%f[set]`, a *frontier pattern*; such item matches an empty string\n    at any position such that the next character belongs to *set* and\n    the previous character does not belong to *set*. The set *set* is\n    interpreted as previously described. The beginning and the end of\n    the subject are handled as if they were the character '`\\0`'.\n\n#### Pattern:\n\nA *pattern* is a sequence of pattern items. A caret '`^`' at the\nbeginning of a pattern anchors the match at the beginning of the subject\nstring. A '`$`' at the end of a pattern anchors the match at the end of\nthe subject string. At other positions, '`^`' and '`$`' have no special\nmeaning and represent themselves.\n\n#### Captures:\n\nA pattern can contain sub-patterns enclosed in parentheses; they\ndescribe *captures*. When a match succeeds, the substrings of the\nsubject string that match captures are stored (*captured*) for future\nuse. Captures are numbered according to their left parentheses. For\ninstance, in the pattern `\"(a*(.)%w(%s*))\"`, the part of the string\nmatching `\"a*(.)%w(%s*)\"` is stored as the first capture (and therefore\nhas number 1); the character matching \"`.`\" is captured with number 2,\nand the part matching \"`%s*`\" has number 3.\n\nAs a special case, the empty capture `()` captures the current string\nposition (a number). For instance, if we apply the pattern `\"()aa()\"` on\nthe string `\"flaaap\"`, there will be two captures: 3 and 5.\n\n6.5 – Table Manipulation\n------------------------\n\nThis library provides generic functions for table manipulation. It\nprovides all its functions inside the table `table`.\n\nRemember that, whenever an operation needs the length of a table, the\ntable should be a proper sequence or have a `__len` metamethod (see\n[§3.4.6](#3.4.6)).
